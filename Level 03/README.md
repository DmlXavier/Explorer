## About
In this level, we delved into HTML and CSS.<br>
Using a "form" webpage layout as a base, we learned about:
- How HTML forms work;
- HTML fields and fieldsets;
- Inputs and its' different types;
- Data validation and submission (back-end not included);
- More stylization solutions using CSS, e.g.:
	- Customizing different elements inside the same box;
	- Using pseudo-classes to add flavor to the page.
