## Technologies

This project used these technologies:

- HTML;
- CSS.

<br/>

## Project

This is the layout of a form from a fictional event organizer. Here the user would fill the form with their information so the organizer can start planning the event. <br/>
The point of this project was to understand these concepts:

- How HTML forms work;
- HTML fields and fieldsets;
- Inputs and its' different types;
- Data validation and submission (back-end not included);
- More stylization solutions using CSS, e.g.:
	- Customizing different elements inside the same box;
	- Using pseudo-classes to add flavor to the page.
