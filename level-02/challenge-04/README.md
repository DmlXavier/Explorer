# **Challenge 04**

Here, i was given "correct" code but confusing and not acessibility-friendly HTML. I had to change it to have better readability and acessibility.

These assignments were made to practice these concepts:
- Making understandable and acessible HTML:
	- Dividing the code into different parts (nav, main and footer);
	- Creating sections (with classes);
- CSS box model and Flexbox;
- CSS pseudo-classes;
- A few more CSS properties.
