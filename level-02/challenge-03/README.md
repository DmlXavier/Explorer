# **Challenge 03**

Like the first challenge, here i was given "broken" code and had to fix it in order to recreate the layout provided.

These assignments were made to practice these concepts:
- Making understandable and acessible HTML:
	- Dividing the code into different parts (nav, main and footer);
	- Creating sections (with classes);
- CSS box model and Flexbox;
- CSS pseudo-classes;
- A few more CSS properties.
