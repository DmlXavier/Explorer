# **Challenge 02**

In this one, i was given only the layout. I had to recreate it by coding it from scratch.

This assignment was made to practice introductory HTML and CSS concepts such as:
- HTML and CSS syntax;
- Setting up the HTML "head" documentation;
- Setting up the HTML "body":
	- Creating divs (with id);
	- Adding headers, paragraphs, images and links;
- CSS cascade effect and specificity;
- Basic CSS properties.
