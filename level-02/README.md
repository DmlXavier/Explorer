## About
The objective of these assignments was to learn and practice the basics of HTML and CSS.

I was provided with four different webpage layouts and had to recreate them using code. Either by fixing "broken" code or from scratch.

## Challenges 03 and 04
Like the first challenge, here i was given "broken" code and had to fix it in order to recreate the layout provided. Both 03 and 04 used the same layout as a model.

In the third challenge, like the first, i was given "broken" CSS and HTML code.<br> 
In the fourth, i was given "correct" code but confusing and not acessibility-friendly HTML. I had to change it to have better readability and acessibility.

These assignments were made to practice these concepts:
- Making understandable and acessible HTML:
	- Dividing the code into different parts (nav, main and footer);
	- Creating sections (with classes);
- CSS box model and Flexbox;
- CSS pseudo-classes;
- A few more CSS properties.
