## About
The objective of these assignments was to practice the basics of HTML and CSS.

I was provided with three different webpage layouts and had to recreate them using code. Either by fixing "broken" code or from scratch.

- Setting up the HTML "body":
	- Creating divs (with id);
	- Adding headers, paragraphs, images and links;

## Challenges 02 and 03
Like the first challenge, here i was given "broken" code and had to fix it in order to recreate the layout provided. Both 02 and 03 used the same layout as a model.

In the second challenge, like the first, i was given "broken" CSS and HTML code.</br> 
In the third, i was given "correct" code but confusing and not acessibility-friendly HTML. I had to change it to have better readability and acessibility.

These assignments were made to practice these concepts:
- Making understandable and acessible HTML:
	- Dividing the code into different parts (nav, main and footer);
	- Creating sections (with classes);
- CSS box model and Flexbox;
- CSS pseudo-classes;
- A few more CSS properties.
